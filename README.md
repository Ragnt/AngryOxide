### A 802.11 Attack tool built in Rust ü¶Ä !

[![Builds and Release](https://github.com/Ragnt/AngryOxide/actions/workflows/ci.yml/badge.svg?branch=master)](https://github.com/Ragnt/AngryOxide/actions/workflows/ci.yml) ![GitHub commit activity](https://img.shields.io/github/commit-activity/m/Ragnt/AngryOxide) [![Discord](https://img.shields.io/discord/1194365883099922643)](https://discord.gg/QsEgaFndsQ)

**This tool is for research purposes only. I am not responsible for anything you do or damage you cause while using AngryOxide. Only use against networks that you have permission.**

AngryOxide was developed as a way to learn Rust, netlink, kernel sockets, and WiFi exploitation all at once.

You can get information about how to use AngryOxide in the [User Guide](https://github.com/Ragnt/AngryOxide/wiki/1.-User-Guide).

NOTE: This project is under HEAVY development and you can expect a very fast release cycle.

The overall goal of this tool is to provide a single-interface survey capability with advanced automated attacks that result in valid hashlines you can crack with [Hashcat](https://hashcat.net/hashcat/).

This tool is heavily inspired by [hcxdumptool](https://github.com/ZerBea/hcxdumptool) and development wouldn't have been possible without help from ZerBea.

If you have questions or any issues, you can reach me on the [AngryOxide Discord](https://discord.gg/QsEgaFndsQ)

## I wanna use it!

```bash
tar -xf angryoxide-linux-x86_64.tar.gz # Untar
chmod +x install.sh # Make executable
sudo ./install.sh # Install (as root, including zsh/bash completions)
```

#### Uninstalling:

```bash
sudo ./install.sh uninstall # Uninstall
```

## Features

- Active state-based attack engine used to retrieve relevent EAPOL messages from Access Points and clients.
- Target option that accepts MAC (aabbcc..., aa:bb:cc...) and SSID "Test_SSID" to limit attack scope.
- Whitelist option to protect specific networks from attacks. Useful if not using targets.
- Auto Hunt capability to find all target channels and hop between them.
- A Terminal-UI that presents all relevent data while still living in the terminal for easy usage over SSH.
- A grepable "Headless" operation mode that simply prints status output, ready to be redirected to a log file.
- Limits DEAUTHENTICATION frames that can cause more damage than good to the authentication sequence.
- EAPOL 4-Way-Handshake validation using Nonce Correction, Replay Counter validation, and Temporal validation.
- Automatically elicits PMKID from access points where available.
- Utilizes GPSD with ability to set remote GPSD service address.
- Ability to enable geo-fencing to force AO to only run when inside a geometric area specified by a latitude, longitude, and radius.
- Provides pcapng files with embedded GPS using the [Kismet Format](https://www.kismetwireless.net/docs/dev/pcapng_gps/).
- Provides a kismetdb file with all frames (with GPS) for post-processing.
- Wraps all output files in a gzipped tarball.
- Bash autocompletions for easy interface selection provided.

## Attacks

Will by default attack ALL access points in range, unless atleast one target is supplied, at which point the tool will only transmit against defined targets. (But will still passively collect on other access points).

- Attempts authentication/association sequence to produce EAPOL Message 1 (PMKID Collection)
- Attempts to retrieve hidden SSID's with direct probe requests.
- Utilizes Anonymous Reassociation to force Access Points to deauthenticate their own clients (MFP Bypass)
- Will attempt to send Channel Switch Announcement to send clients to adjacent channels.
- Attempts to downgrade RSN modes to WPA2-CCMP (Probe Response Injection via RogueM2)
- Attempts to collect EAPOL M2 from stations based solely on Probe Requests (RogueM2)
- Attempts to disassociate clients using WiFi 6e codes that prevent blacklisting
- All attacks can be manually disabled.

All of these attacks are rate-controlled both to prevent erroneous EAPOL timer resets and to maintain some level of operational security.

## Building from source

If you want to build from source instead of using precompiled binaries, these are the basic instructions:

```
# Install Rust
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Clone this repo
git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/Ragnt/AngryOxide.git

# Build/Install
cd AngryOxide
make
sudo make install
```

This will build from source, install into /usr/bin/angryoxide, and install the bash completions for you.

### Cross compiling:

I use [cross](https://github.com/cross-rs/cross) to cross compile to embedded architectures.

Here is MIPS (mips-unknown-linux-musl) as an example.

```
# make sure you have the nightly installed
rustup install nightly

# dynamically linked & soft-float
cross build +nightly --target mips-unknown-linux-musl --release -Zbuild-std
```


### Completions script:

These make using AngryOxide with bash and zsh a bit more fluid, automatically finding your wireless interfaces for you and showing you the arguments in a tab-completable way.
