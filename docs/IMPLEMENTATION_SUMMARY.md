# macOS Support Implementation Summary

## What Was Accomplished

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure ✅

1. **BPF Raw Socket Implementation (`src/rawsocks.rs`)**
   - Implemented BPF device discovery (`/dev/bpf*`)
   - Added BPF ioctl operations for packet capture
   - Configured buffer sizes, immediate mode, and promiscuous mode
   - Set up DLT (Data Link Type) for 802.11 radiotap
   - Created non-blocking socket configuration

2. **Build Configuration (`Cargo.toml`)**
   - Added macOS-specific dependencies
   - Configured conditional compilation targets

3. **Platform Abstraction Layer (`src/interface.rs`)**
   - Created unified interface for Linux (nl80211) and macOS operations
   - Implemented `Nl80211Mock` for macOS with stub methods
   - Added Band type compatibility between platforms
   - Created interface enumeration using ifconfig

4. **Type System Compatibility**
   - Fixed Interface struct fields for cross-platform compatibility
   - Added conversion methods (`from_u8`, `to_u8`) for Band types
   - Resolved HashMap vs Vec return type issues
   - Fixed MacAddress construction

5. **UI Compatibility (`src/ui.rs`)**
   - Replaced terminal-clipboard with pbcopy for macOS clipboard support
   - Fixed field access patterns for platform-specific Interface structs

## Current State

### What Works
- ✅ Code compiles for macOS target (with stubbed functionality)
- ✅ Linux build remains fully functional and unaffected
- ✅ Conditional compilation structure established
- ✅ Basic BPF device operations implemented
- ✅ Platform abstraction layer in place

### What Needs Implementation
- ❌ Actual packet reception through BPF
- ❌ Packet injection through BPF
- ❌ CoreWLAN integration for interface management
- ❌ Monitor mode detection and enablement
- ❌ Airport utility integration
- ❌ IOKit-based MAC address management
- ❌ Interface up/down control
- ❌ Channel switching functionality

## Key Technical Decisions

1. **BPF vs AF_PACKET**: Implemented Berkeley Packet Filter for macOS as the equivalent to Linux's AF_PACKET sockets

2. **Abstraction Strategy**: Used conditional compilation (`#[cfg(target_os = "...")]`) throughout rather than runtime detection

3. **Mock Implementation**: Created `Nl80211Mock` to maintain API compatibility while stubbing macOS-specific operations

4. **Type Compatibility**: Used wrapper types and conversion traits to bridge platform-specific differences

## Testing Status

- Compilation test: ✅ Passes for macOS target
- Runtime tests: ❌ Not yet functional (stub implementations)
- Linux regression: ✅ No impact on Linux functionality

## Next Steps for Full Implementation

1. **Complete BPF Implementation**
   - Implement actual packet reading from BPF
   - Add packet injection support
   - Handle BPF buffer management

2. **CoreWLAN Integration**
   - Use CoreWLAN framework for interface discovery
   - Implement channel switching
   - Add monitor mode detection

3. **System Integration**
   - Integrate with Airport utility for monitor mode
   - Add IOKit for hardware management
   - Implement interface control operations

4. **Testing & Validation**
   - Create macOS-specific test suite
   - Validate packet capture/injection
   - Performance testing and optimization

## Files Modified

- `src/rawsocks.rs` - BPF implementation
- `src/interface.rs` - Platform abstraction layer
- `src/ui.rs` - UI compatibility fixes
- `src/main.rs` - Type compatibility fixes
- `Cargo.toml` - Build configuration
- `MACOS_SUPPORT_PLAN.md` - Documentation

## Known Limitations

1. Monitor mode support depends on hardware and driver capabilities
2. Channel switching requires disassociation on macOS
3. Some operations require System Integrity Protection (SIP) considerations
4. BPF has different performance characteristics than AF_PACKET

## Recommendations

1. **Testing Environment**: Set up a dedicated macOS test machine with known-compatible WiFi hardware
2. **Incremental Approach**: Test each component (capture, injection, channel switch) independently
3. **Documentation**: Create user guide for macOS-specific setup requirements
4. **CI/CD**: Add macOS runners to GitHub Actions for automated testing

This implementation provides a solid foundation for macOS support while maintaining full Linux compatibility. The abstraction layer allows for incremental implementation of macOS-specific features without disrupting the existing Linux functionality.
