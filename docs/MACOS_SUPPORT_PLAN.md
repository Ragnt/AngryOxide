# macOS Support Implementation Plan for AngryOxide

## Executive Summary

This document outlines a comprehensive plan to add macOS compatibility to AngryOxide while maintaining full Linux support. The implementation uses conditional compilation and platform abstraction layers to keep the codebase unified.

## Current State Analysis

### Existing Infrastructure
- Basic conditional compilation structure already in place
- Platform abstraction files created:
  - `src/interface.rs` - Wireless interface management abstraction
  - `src/rawsocks.rs` - Raw socket abstraction (stubs for macOS)
- UI clipboard handling already supports both platforms

### Platform-Specific Components Requiring Implementation

1. **Raw Socket Operations** (`src/rawsocks.rs`)
   - Linux: Uses AF_PACKET sockets
   - macOS: Needs BPF (Berkeley Packet Filter) implementation

2. **Wireless Interface Management** (`src/interface.rs`)
   - Linux: Uses nl80211 via netlink
   - macOS: Needs CoreWLAN/IOKit implementation

3. **Monitor Mode Support**
   - Linux: Native support via nl80211
   - macOS: Limited; requires specific hardware and drivers

4. **Packet Injection**
   - Linux: Direct write to AF_PACKET socket
   - macOS: BPF device with DLT_IEEE802_11_RADIO

## Implementation Strategy

### Phase 1: Core Infrastructure (Week 1-2) ‚úÖ COMPLETED

#### 1.1 BPF Raw Socket Implementation ‚úÖ
```rust
// src/rawsocks.rs - macOS implementation
- ‚úÖ Implement BPF device discovery (/dev/bpf*)
- ‚úÖ Set up proper BPF filters for 802.11 frames
- ‚úÖ Configure immediate mode and buffer sizes
- ‚úÖ Handle radiotap headers for injection
```

#### 1.2 Update Build Configuration ‚úÖ
```toml
# Cargo.toml
[target.'cfg(target_os = "macos")'.dependencies]
core-foundation = "0.9" ‚úÖ
core-foundation-sys = "0.8" ‚úÖ
system-configuration = "0.5" ‚úÖ
# iokit-sys = "0.1" - Not added yet, may be needed later
```

### Phase 2: Wireless Interface Management (Week 2-3) ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Status**: Interface management fully implemented using Airport utility and ioctl

#### 2.1 Airport Utility Integration ‚úÖ
```rust
// src/airport.rs - COMPLETED
- ‚úÖ Enumerate wireless interfaces using Airport
- ‚úÖ Get interface capabilities and state
- ‚úÖ Handle channel switching via Airport
- ‚úÖ Implement monitor mode detection and control
```

#### 2.2 Interface Abstraction Updates ‚úÖ
```rust
// src/interface.rs - COMPLETED
- ‚úÖ Complete Nl80211Mock implementation with Airport integration
- ‚úÖ Implement interface up/down control via ioctl (SIOCSIFFLAGS)
- ‚úÖ MAC address management
- ‚úÖ Channel and frequency management
```

### Phase 3: Monitor Mode & Packet Injection (Week 3-4) ‚úÖ COMPLETED

**Status**: Full monitor mode support and packet injection implemented

#### 3.1 Airport Utility Integration ‚úÖ
```rust
// src/airport.rs - COMPLETED
- ‚úÖ Detect airport utility availability
- ‚úÖ Implement monitor mode enable/disable
- ‚úÖ Handle dissociation requirements
- ‚úÖ Manage channel hopping limitations

```

#### 3.2 BPF Packet Injection ‚úÖ COMPLETED
```rust
// Update src/rawsocks.rs
- ‚úÖ Implement proper radiotap header construction
- ‚úÖ Handle BPF write semantics
- ‚úÖ Add retry logic for injection failures
- ‚úÖ BPF header parsing and packet extraction
- ‚úÖ Multiple packet handling per read()
- ‚úÖ Alignment handling (BPF_WORDALIGN)
```

### Phase 4: Platform Compatibility Layer (Week 4-5)

#### 4.1 Common Interface Traits
```rust
// src/platform.rs - New file
trait WirelessInterface {
    fn set_monitor_mode(&self, enable: bool) -> Result<()>;
    fn set_channel(&self, channel: u8, band: Band) -> Result<()>;
    fn inject_frame(&self, frame: &[u8]) -> Result<()>;
    fn receive_frame(&self) -> Result<Vec<u8>>;
}
```

#### 4.2 Factory Pattern for Platform Selection
```rust
// src/platform.rs
pub fn create_wireless_interface(name: &str) -> Box<dyn WirelessInterface> {
    #[cfg(target_os = "linux")]
    return Box::new(LinuxInterface::new(name));

    #[cfg(target_os = "macos")]
    return Box::new(MacOSInterface::new(name));
}
```

### Phase 5: Testing & Validation (Week 5-6)

#### 5.1 Unit Tests
- Platform-specific test modules
- Mock BPF devices for testing
- Interface enumeration tests

#### 5.2 Integration Tests
- Cross-platform frame injection tests
- Monitor mode capability detection
- Channel switching validation

## Technical Challenges & Solutions

### Challenge 1: Limited Monitor Mode Support
**Problem**: macOS restricts monitor mode and not all hardware supports it.
**Solution**:
- Runtime capability detection
- Graceful degradation with informative errors
- Document supported hardware list

### Challenge 2: BPF Complexity
**Problem**: BPF has different semantics than AF_PACKET.
**Solution**:
- Abstract packet I/O behind traits
- Implement comprehensive error handling
- Add BPF-specific optimizations

### Challenge 3: Channel Control Limitations
**Problem**: macOS doesn't allow channel changes while associated.
**Solution**:
- Force disassociation before channel change
- Cache and restore network state
- Implement channel validation

### Challenge 4: Root/Admin Requirements
**Problem**: Both platforms need elevated privileges differently.
**Solution**:
- Platform-specific privilege checking
- Clear error messages for permission issues
- Document setup requirements

## Build and Distribution

### Development Build
```bash
# macOS
cargo build --release

# Linux
cargo build --release

# Cross-platform testing
cargo test --all-features
```

### CI/CD Updates
